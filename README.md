# dw_footnotes_wp_plugin
This is my modification of the Wordpress plugin created by Mark Cheret. Here is the link to the Original plugin: https://pl.wordpress.org/plugins/footnotes/

Case study
The original plugins works pretty well, but there were some limitations. I cannot placed the references in any other place of the post content than in the end of the post. According my editors, the bibliography should be last, so referenceesh sould be placed before the bibliography.

I solve it by adding shortcode-like solution. The editor can decide where to add references by using the text: [footnotesshortcode]. It can be placed in any part of the post content.
